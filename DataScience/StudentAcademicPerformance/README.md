* Had difficulties with ggplots not correctly outputting. Troubleshooted adding dependcies manually until finally removed variables assigned to ggplots and instead had each plot on its own code snippet.We also had issues encoding categorical variables for multiple regression models, which sometimes caused misalignments with column indices. We used Copilot to help correct issue by using pd.get_dummiesto handle dummy variable creation effectively.
