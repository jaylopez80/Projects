* I initially had issues with handling the categorical variables resulting in incorrect data formats. I had to set the sparse_output paramater to false to solve this issue in the preprocessing. I also struggled with low recall and ROC AUC scores for the first data set, which resulted in changing my selected continuous and categoricaal variables.
