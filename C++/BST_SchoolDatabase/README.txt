Compile command : g++ *.cpp -o db
Run: ./db
Testing: Using menu options add/manipulate student & faculty
    For this project I implemented student and faculty database using classes to hold the member values that hold their pertaining information. I implimented the 
functionality of the database in my DataBase class. The database class incorporated the LAZYBST class in order to create the student and faculty tables. 
Using the bst to sort the members by ID and overloaded comparison, database allows for the user to manipulate the database menu and add/delete
members as needed.
